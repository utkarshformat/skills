## Formatting rules

1. **Markdown tables render correctly in Notion, Linear, GitHub, and Google Docs.** Keep them simple — no nested lists inside cells.

2. **Every quote is verbatim.** Don't polish. Customer language is the point.

3. **Every quote has attribution** — `"[Quote]" — [First name], [Company]`. If Format data doesn't have a first name, use the role: "— [Role], [Company]".

4. **Keep section headers and numbering consistent** with the template above. Downstream skills may parse this file by header.

5. **Flag gaps, don't fabricate.** Where Format data doesn't cover a section or subsection, insert:

   > *Gap — founder input needed. Format data doesn't cover this. Paste your [homepage / pricing page / one-liner / founder description] and Claude can enrich this section.*

   Do not write placeholder text like "[to be filled]" or invent generic content.

6. **Thematic clustering in Customer Language.** The section is only valuable if quotes are clustered into 3–5 themes with bolded labels. Raw quote dumps are not acceptable. Each theme label should be short, customer-voiced, and memorable (e.g. "We're data rich and insight poor").

7. **Switching Dynamics needs 2–3 quotes per force.** If a force has zero quotes, flag it. If it has one, note confidence is limited. This section is too valuable to render without real evidence.

8. **Objections table needs customer-proof rebuttals.** The "Customer proof" column should be a quote from a customer who overcame the objection — not just Claude's rebuttal. If no proof quote exists, leave the cell empty and note: *Rebuttal needs validation.*

9. **Competitive landscape uses the high/medium/low risk structure.** Only fall back to a flat list if fewer than 5 competitors appear in Format data. Never invent competitors not mentioned in customer conversations.

10. **Inline + file.** Always do both — render the full document in chat, and save to disk + present with `present_files`.

11. **End with the enrichment prompt.** After `present_files`, append one line:
    > *Want to fill the gaps? Paste any of these and I'll enrich the relevant sections: your homepage URL, pricing page, one-liner, or founder's description of the business.*

12. **Enrichment mode preserves customer data.** When the user responds with URLs or text, use it to fill gap-flagged sections only. Never overwrite customer-grounded sections with marketing-website language. Mark enriched sections with: *Enriched from [source] on [date].*
